# First sprint-review meeting

## Work deliverables
1. [Dynamic rendering of cards](/specs/img4doc/card-demo.mp4)
2. [CardManager.js](/specs/img4doc/CardManager.mp4)

## What we did
1. Saumya : This sprint went smoothly as we successfully implemented multiple card designs with consistent functionality.
The workload was lighter than expected, so for the next sprint, I’d like to take on more responsibilities to maximize productivity and further contribute to the project.
2. Rommel : I worked on the hover effect for the cards and I think the workload was OK.
3. Evgeny : I worked on shuffle() function from CardManager.js
   .I think it was a small task load-wise, so I feel that I could do more last sprint
4. Yunsong Yang : I implemented card.js, which dynamically renders cards, and tested it with the card-design group; since the workload was relatively light, I believe we can make more progress in the second sprint.
5. Mitchell : The part that I completed was structuring the functions for the card manager file
   . I did the moveCard function
   . I looked over the tests and implementations and provided comments for documentation
6. Victoria : Worked on filterCards in cardManager and workload was less than expected. To finish on time, we can increase workload, which is what we have planned this week for our team. Having smaller teams within a larger team also has been beneficial in making sure things get done.
7. Vivian : I created different types of cards and tested them to ensure they could be dynamically rendered correctly. I feel that the workload wasn’t very heavy, so we can adjust it in the next sprint.
8. Alex : I mostly worked on test cases for Card manager and set up a plan for the deck function and discard function. I was going to implement my plan for the discard function today.
9. Joshua : I created the card-dealing animation and tested it to ensure it works as intended.
10. Raeed : I created the card-flip animation and ensured it works properly.

## Workload Reflection:
The workload was relatively light and should be increased appropriately in the next sprint.

## Feedback:
The card design is a bit simplistic and could be improved for better visual appeal.

## Next Steps:
Build the deck, discard pile, and player components, and implement basic interactions between them.
