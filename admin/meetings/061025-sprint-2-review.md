## Retrospective
### What Went Well
- MVP delivered on schedule  
- Critical flicker bug resolved swiftly  
- Strong peer-review culture 
- Cross-functional collaboration on UI, animation, and transitions  

### What Needs Improvement
- Workload imbalance 
- Late scope changes introduced edge cases  
- Testing window compressed due to end-loaded development  

## Action Items for Next Sprint
1. Starting to have a heavier workload before exam weeks so that it'll be an easier time to test the product during the final weeks.  
2. Try to do better in terms of organization and splitting up tasks. To improve, maybe we don't have as many working branches at one time, or at least more open communication about what is where.  
3. Don't leave majority of the work for the last days before the deadline  
4. We could have a deadline before the final deadline to prevent last minute issues  
5. Have a final deadline to “finish” the base game in order to use more time on honing the product, leaving modularity in the base code to allow for upgradability.
