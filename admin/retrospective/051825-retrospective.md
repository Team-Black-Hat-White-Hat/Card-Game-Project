# First sprint retrospective

## What we went well
1. Having several leaders positively affected workflow
2. I think the sprint was very well organized and the tasks were clear
3. Small meetings after class to make sure we are on track
4. Active communication during the whole sprint
5. We have unit tests for many files
6. Smaller teams within the group to split tasks/functionalities
7. As a group we finished a majority of the tasks given in the first sprint
8. Everyone was able to complete their assigned tasks on time.

## What Didn't Go Well?
1. The estimation was not very accurate
2. The estimation was not very accurate 
3.  Work load was too light
4. Our bus factor is relatively low — without Vivian, progress might slow down significantly.
5. The task distribution is not balanced

## Everyone voted on the topics they wanted to discuss.

1. **Our bus factor is relatively low**: We should hold our meetings in person, right after the Tuesday and Thursday lectures. Sometimes we can also work together offline. If you have some free time, feel free to ask your teammates or other team leads if there's anything you can help with.
2. **The task distribution is not balanced**: In the next sprint, we’ve scheduled more work and adopted a flexible working approach. Since tasks can’t always be distributed perfectly evenly—and with the addition of front-end tasks—those with more free time are encouraged to help with front-end development.

Analysis: The team showed relatively low levels of engagement, impact, and sense of meaning. I believe this is because we assigned too few tasks in the last sprint, and the lack of timely feedback resulted in a lighter workload for most members. I think we should improve our feedback mechanisms, and everyone should make an effort to stay more engaged. If anyone notices an estimation issue, they should speak up as soon as possible.
