## Management - Group Contract

### 1. Personal Goals

As individuals, we hope to gain experience working in SE teams and become better prepared to enter the industry. We also aim to gain experience with the web stack and become better 'T-shaped developers' by enhancing our knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Achieving these goals will benefit everyone, as when we become better team players, we will be able to work more efficiently and more comfortably.

This project will not only aid us professionally but also personally, fostering a more collaborative mindset and promoting empathy as we strive to create an environment of psychological safety.

### 2. Values, Mission, and Common Goals

Our team values collaboration, accountability, and open-mindedness. We believe that respectful communication and a shared commitment to high-quality outcomes are key to our success.

We’re engaging in this project to apply what we’ve learned in software engineering to a real-world scenario. This project provides an opportunity to practice team collaboration, design thinking, and iterative development while building something fun and meaningful.

Our team aims to bring unique value by creating a card battle game with a campus theme, combining familiar student life elements with engaging gameplay mechanics. We want to demonstrate that even with a limited number of cards, meaningful interactions can be designed through well-thought-out systems.

As a team, our key milestones include building a working MVP that features basic card battle mechanics, implementing a user-friendly interface, and ensuring smooth turn-based interactions. We also plan to test our system with real users to gather feedback and iterate on our design. Our ultimate goal is to make every player feel engaged in the game.
