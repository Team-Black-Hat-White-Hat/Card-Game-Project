## 1. Personal Goals
   As individuals we hope to gain experience working in SE teams, and become better prepared to enter the industry. We also hope to gain experience with the web stack and become better ‘T-shaped developers’ by improving our knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
   
Achieving these goals will benefit everyone, as when we become better team players, we will be able to work more efficiently and more comfortably.

   This project will help us not only professionally, but also personally, to become more collaboratively-minded and empathetic of others, as we hope to create an environment of psychological safety.
## 2. Values, Mission, and Common Goals
   Our team values collaboration, accountability, and open-mindedness. We believe that respectful communication and a shared commitment to high-quality outcomes are key to our success.
   
   We’re engaging in this project to apply what we’ve learned in software engineering to a real-world scenario. This project gives us the opportunity to practice team collaboration, design thinking, and iterative development while building something fun and meaningful. We also hope to explore game design principles and create a product that others can enjoy.
   
   Our team aims to bring unique value by creating a card battle game with a campus theme, combining familiar student life elements with engaging gameplay mechanics. We want to show that even with a limited number of cards, it's possible to design meaningful interactions through well-thought-out systems. This project allows us to explore both game design and technical implementation in a way that’s fun, strategic, and relevant to our experience as students.
   
   As a team, we aim to achieve several key milestones throughout the project. These include building a working MVP that features basic card battle mechanics, implementing a user-friendly interface, and ensuring smooth turn-based interactions. We also plan to test our system with real users to gather feedback and iterate on our design.Our ultimate goal is to make every player feel engaged in the game.
## 3. Strengths and Weaknesses
   **Time commitment**: Some of our members have a more flexible schedule, which allows them to contribute additional time and effort to the group. Other members have tight schedules due to their other classes and only have a fixed number of hours they can dedicate per week. To address this, we will have scheduled sprint meetings and stand-up meetings, so that regardless of who is available at what times throughout the week, we can touch base. We would like to emphasize that there’s no penalty for not finishing a task; we all want a successful project and we help each other out when needed.
   
   **Teamwork**: Some members are good communicators and willing to help teammates whenever they need assistance. Other members are less comfortable working in a big team like this. We will try to apply the concepts we learned in class, about channels of communication, and will use pair programming to facilitate information sharing.
   
   **Communication**: Our team members have a wide range of English fluency, which sometimes makes it difficult for everyone to fully understand the topic or the content of group discussions. We will address this by communicating with teammates more frequently, asking them to repeat or clarify when confused, and seek help when encountering difficulties.
   
   **Motivation**: Some members tend to feel discouraged or want to give up when they encounter problems or challenges. We will address this by making sure everyone can rely on their teammates; two heads is better than one, and we have eleven!
   
   **Experience**: Some members have a strong background in the web stack and JavaScript. Others are beginners. We will address this by working in teams/pairs, so we can learn from one another, and continue to practice on our own. We will be open minded and simply learn what works and doesn’t through the sprints.


## 4. People, Roles, and Accountabilities
   - Clearly specify roles within your team.
        - Tip: You may want to have some flexibility in your team’s roles to account for absences and busy schedules.  
     
   - Assign responsibilities to each member to ensure accountability.
     - Account for logistical responsibilities, such as taking meeting notes, creating tasks, etc.    
<br>
- **Leaders** (Vivian and Yunsong and Mitchell): Responsible for overseeing the group and guiding the project direction. This might include:  
  - Making announcements and ensuring every team member has all the information
  - Leading meetings
       - facilitating voting/decision-making by the whole team
       - preparing meeting agenda/notes
  - Project related:
       - Directory organization, general project architecture
       - Check up on all sub-teams/pairs, make sure the work everyone is doing can be safely integrated
  - Interpersonal:
       - Checking up on all team members, making sure everyone is comfortable
       - Resolving disputes between team members
    - Checking in with our TA, Tony, every Wednesday
- **Rotating** responsibilities: Taking meeting minutes and filling out in-class activity sheets are responsibilities that will be rotated throughout the team, depending on who is available. 

- **All members** are expected to participate in sprints and write code. Sub-group leaders are additionally responsible for outlining the direction of their group’s work, and for more software architecture concerns.


## 5. Needs and Expectations
- **What do we need from one another to succeed?**
  - Our team needs everyone to be dependable, as this was one of the traits Google found was important for a successful team. This means team members reliably complete quality work on time. When a team member says they will do something, we expect them to follow through on it. In this kind of team, everyone will be able to rely on each other for help and work will get done in a timely manner. We need empathy from one another, as we are human beings first and members of the team second; things happen, life gets in the way, and we want to be kind to one another if we can’t quite meet a deadline or get something to work.  
  
  - ‘Be strict with yourself and be tolerant of others’; one cannot control what others do, only what oneself does. With this in mind, we want to try to each do our own best and avoid pointing fingers or naming and shaming others, whose behavior we can’t control.

- **Expectations for collaboration**
  - We expect team members working on the same task to keep regular communication through Slack, and delegate sub-tasks as they see fit according to time or skills required. We expect team members to do an approximately equal amount of work and do not want anybody to shirk their responsibilities. At the same time, we do not want team members to hog all the work and prevent their teammates from working. If issues like this arise, we expect them to communicate and work it out, or contact a team leader to mediate if needed. Team members working on the same task can use whatever strategies they think work best; for example, one driver and one observer swapping periodically.

- **Individual availability and risks relating to time commitment and resource management**
  - Individuals on the team have varying schedules and some people are busier than others. We do not want anyone to be forced to sacrifice another class in order to get work done for this class; at the same time, being busy is not an excuse to avoid doing work for this class.
  - Based on CSE110 being a 4-credit class with 50% of the grade being the group project, we expect members to be able to spend at least 4 hours per week on group project assignments. This estimate is not strict and everyone’s time availability will vary by week, but we want to emphasize that reasons like taking 5 classes or having a job are not excuses to consistently avoid working on the project.
  - If a team member is consistently unable to complete their fair share of the workload, they can reach out to a leader and discuss possible next steps. A leader might also reach out to them if they notice an issue, or a team member can let a leader know if they notice someone else having an issue with their assigned workload. We want to have an open, respectful discussion to make sure everyone is on the same page about expectations and solve the issue at hand.
  - Some solutions might include: re-organizing tasks, re-organizing sub-teams, or moving internal deadlines. If the issue persists, we may bring it up to our TA to mediate the conversation.
- **Team communication strategies**
  - As we learnt in class, to be effective communicators we want to:
    1. Focus on the message over the delivery
    2. Acknowledge others’ feelings
    3. Acknowledge that communication styles vary and allow for differences
    4. Avoid dominating the communication
    5. Remember that communication is a skill and we are all learning to do it all the time
- **Conflict resolution process**  
As we outlined above, if a conflict arises between two members,
    - they can contact the leaders, or
    - the leaders may contact them if they observe the conflict, or
    - another group member may contact the leaders if they observe the conflict.
  
    The leaders will then set up a meeting. In this meeting, we aim to:
    - hear both sides of the story
    - discuss in a respectful but honest manner
    - mediate a resolution,  which might involve:
        - clearing up misunderstandings
        - agreeing on a compromise
        - moving the members to different sub-groups  
      
    If the conflict cannot be resolved, we may contact the TA as an outside mediator.

## 6. Rules and Activities
- Our team plans to adopt a pair-based working model, where each pair will have an internal leader responsible for managing tasks and coordinating efforts within the pair. The pairing would consist of 3 subteams of 4 members (one team would have three members since there are 11 members), each team consists of 2 frontend members and 2 backend members. Task distribution will be handled autonomously within each pair. Project progress will be tracked using GitHub Issues. Before starting any coding work, team members will sketch out their initial ideas and document them in their personal branches. This documentation will include diagrams or notes to outline their planned approach. Afterward, they will begin implementation and conduct thorough testing. Once testing is completed, the code will undergo a peer review by a different pair before it is merged into the main branch. Proper documentation will also be finalized during this stage.     
  <br>
  Each pair will stay in close contact and hold stand-up meetings every two to three days. Additionally, the full group will meet weekly to present individual progress, discuss any challenges encountered, and share ideas for improving the project — including adjustments when certain tasks turn out to be more difficult than expected.  
  <br>
  If a team member wants to introduce a new feature that goes beyond the MVP (Minimum Viable Product), they should first build a simple demo and provide an estimate of the required effort before discussing it with the group.  
   <br>
- Our team defines success in several ways. First, the project goals must be accomplished on time. Second, the code should pass all necessary tests and meet quality standards — this includes proper structure, readability, and refactoring when needed. Third, team members should feel satisfied with both their individual contributions and the overall collaboration.  
  <br> 
  In addition, thorough documentation and consistent issue tracking on GitHub are essential to maintaining transparency and ensuring that progress is visible and manageable throughout the project.  
   <br>
  We also recognize that failures or conflicts may occur during the process. In such cases, team members are encouraged to openly communicate with each other or reach out to their pair leads or team leaders to find constructive solutions together.  
   <br>
- To ensure fair and equal contributions from all team members, we expect everyone to contribute as equally as possible. We understand that emergencies or unexpected situations may occur, so team members should inform their pair leader if they are unable to complete a task on time.  
  <br> 
  Each pair will evaluate contributions weekly, not only based on output but also on engagement and communication. As part of this process, each member is responsible for writing a short reflection highlighting both the strengths and areas for improvement of themselves and their partner. This promotes accountability, transparency, and mutual support within the team.  
## 7. The definition of the subgroup and rules

- **About stand-up meeting**:The stand-up meeting will be hosted by the subgroup leader, and the frequency depends on the subgroup.
   We will talk about:  
   1. What did I do Yesterday? Describe the work you completed yesterday.
   2. What do I plan to do today? Briefly state your work plan or tasks for today.
   3. What obstacles am I facing? Report any current difficulties or blockers; the team or Scrum Master may assist.
   
  The subgroup leader should document the meeting content and, if necessary, schedule a follow-up meeting to resolve any issues. If the problem remains unresolved, they may consult with members of other subgroups for support.  
<br>
- **About code style**:
  1. Use camelCase for variable and function names
      ```
      let userName = 'Alice';
      function getUserData() {}
      ```

  2. Use SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE for constants
      ```
      const API_KEY = 'your-key-here';
      ```

  3. Use 2 spaces for indentation (the JavaScript community standard)

  4. Use const and let, avoid var

  5. Use single quotes ' for strings, unless double quotes are needed inside

  6. Please feel free to use VSCode’s auto format command, which is Shift + Alt + F or Shift + Option + F, to fix nesting and line spacing.

  7. Please add comments before functions and variables whose names do not clearly indicate their purpose.

- **About dev tools** 
  1. Vscode
  2. Github
  3. Chrome
  4. Jest
  5. Miro white board
  6. GitHub Pull Requests is an official VS Code extension that allows you to view, review, and manage GitHub pull requests directly within the editor.


- **About Branch strategy**:
  1. main Branch (Production Branch)
     This is the production branch that contains tested and deployable code.
     No one should develop directly on main or push to it without a proper review.
     We only merge into main when a release is ready to go live.

  2. dev Branch (Development Mainline)
     This is the integration branch where all feature development is merged.
     Every developer's work (from feature branches) is pulled into dev.
     Testing and integration happen here.
     main is updated by merging code from dev.

  3. feature/xxx Branches (Feature Branches)
  Every new feature, module, or page should be developed in its own feature/xxx branch from dev.
  Developers work independently in these branches.
  Once completed, the feature branch is merged back into dev via a Pull Request.

  4. bugfix/xxx or hotfix/xxx Branches (Fix Branches)  
  bugfix/xxx: For fixing issues during development (branched from dev).  
  hotfix/xxx: For urgent production bugs (branched from main).  
  *After fixing, merge back into the source branch (dev or main) and also sync to the other if needed.*  
- Merge rules  
  1. The code can be merged after all unit tests pass and a code review has been completed by a teammate from another group.
  2. Always fetch/pull the latest code before starting new development


- **About GitHub Issues and Documentation**
  1. We use it to report and track bug
  2. We use it to request new features
  3. We use it to write user’s story
  4. We use it to write API docs

- **The definition of done**
  1. Complete the task on time
  2. Write clean, readable, and maintainable code, and refactor when necessary
  3. Good API documentation.
  4. Unit test
  5. Meeting minutes


- **Some tips**:
  1. Write some demo programs before starting formal development.
  2. Spend some time on design, including creating wireframes, before starting actual coding.
  3. Build user-friendly APIs to facilitate collaboration across separate groups.
