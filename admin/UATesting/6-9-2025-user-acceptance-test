User's background: Not a member of our team but has taken CSE110 previously, experienced player of Slay the Spire.
I had the user open up our repo and follow the instructions in our Readme. They opted to play from the deployed fork on v3yu account.
These notes are from their comments whilst playing through our game.

- user couldn't figure out what element to click in the first cutscene because it was all black
- spaghetti code shield card is bugged, doesn't correctly give extra block if you didn't attack
- user didn't read the flavor text on cards or powell dialogue (was apparently too focused on winning)
- user thinks freeboba should be a 0 cost card (it's not free and its effect is strictly worse than Trip to Student Health)
- there is no way to go back to the home page / restart the game
- block and energy icons are too small but HP bar is a good size
- energy icon should visually match energy on cards 
- they think they should be able to see at least some of the text on bottom of card before hovering, like in Slay The Spire
- they liked the story cutscene and thinks the story/visual novel aspect is what differentiates it from STS, I mentioned our past idea of having 7 levels with each level being a floor of Geisel and they liked that idea a lot

My notes:
- I thought the Spaghetti Code Shield card worked, I remember testing it - but we unfortunately didn't actually have unit tests for any cards because we made them so early on that all their dependencies didn't exist
- I knew the game was poorly balanced, this is partially because Powell uses an attack that does nothing half the time and partially because players can block but he can't
- I never thought about the energy icon matching but I completely agree, it's good practice to encourage recognition over recall so users can just see the icon and be like 'Ah, I see, that means energy'
- The user, who took CSE110 with Powell two years ago, and also took CSE210, thought that we'd done a tremendous amount of work for the time we got, and commented that we would have probably been able to add more features if we'd had a full 10 weeks.
- I think that kind of defeats the purpose of UAT since we always say 'the developer is not the user' but what if the user is a developer...? Nonetheless I think this perspective is quite valuable.
