1. **Clarify** user requirements, write user stories, and ensure the team has a shared understanding of the feature.(Write into GitHub issues)
2. **Sprint Planning**(Each subgroup held its own meeting with two leaders from the other subgroups participating.): Hold a planning meeting at the beginning of each weekly(TBD)  
 *Sprint to ensure that all three subgroups share a clear understanding of the feature and collaboratively estimate the time required for its completion.*
3. Design the layout and user interface (UI), define page transitions based on real usage scenarios, and draw wireframes to visualize the structure and flow.(**Use Miro whiteboard to create this part**)
4. Type the feature details into a GitHub issue, including descriptions and acceptance criteria, to enable progress tracking and ensure transparency within the team.
5. Build prototypes of the subfeatures to help estimate the required development time.Include the estimated development time in the GitHub issue to improve planning accuracy and facilitate progress tracking.
6. Begin implementing the feature according to the planned design and requirements.
7. Conduct the daily stand-up meeting
8. **Sprint Review**(The whole group must participate.):Conduct the Sprint Review meeting to assess how much work was completed during the Sprint, collect feedback from stakeholders, and update future time or effort estimates as needed.
